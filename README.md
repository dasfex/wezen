# wezen
Small header-only library for metaprogramming.
I try to not repeat STL but in some places I am.

### Support different math functions


### Tests
In every header you can find tests and use it as examples. 
To launch tests use ```-DTEST``` when compile.

### Naming
Library is named as [Wezen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Canis_Majoris).
